Example 2:
The dataset is related to direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese
banking institution. The classification goal is to predict whether the client will
subscribe (1/0) to a term deposit (variable y). The dataset provides the bank customers’
information. It includes 41,188 records and 21 fields.
Input variables
1. age (numeric)
2. job : type of job (categorical: “admin”, “blue-collar”, “entrepreneur”,
“housemaid”, “management”, “retired”, “self-employed”, “services”, “student”,
“technician”, “unemployed”, “unknown”)
3. marital : marital status (categorical: “divorced”, “married”, “single”,
“unknown”)
4. education (categorical: “basic.4y”, “basic.6y”, “basic.9y”, “high.school”,
“illiterate”, “professional.course”, “university.degree”, “unknown”)
5. default: has credit in default? (categorical: “no”, “yes”, “unknown”)
6. housing: has housing loan? (categorical: “no”, “yes”, “unknown”)
7. loan: has personal loan? (categorical: “no”, “yes”, “unknown”)
8. contact: contact communication type (categorical: “cellular”, “telephone”)
9. month: last contact month of year (categorical: “jan”, “feb”, “mar”, …, “nov”,
“dec”)
10. day_of_week: last contact day of the week (categorical: “mon”, “tue”, “wed”,
“thu”, “fri”)
11. duration: last contact duration, in seconds (numeric). Important note: this
attribute highly affects the output target (e.g., if duration=0 then y=’no’). The
duration is not known before a call is performed, also, after the end of the call, y
is obviously known. Thus, this input should only be included for benchmark
purposes and should be discarded if the intention is to have a realistic predictive
model

12. campaign: number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client
(numeric, includes last contact)
13. pdays: number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a
previous campaign (numeric; 999 means client was not previously contacted)
14. previous: number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client
(numeric)
15. poutcome: outcome of the previous marketing campaign (categorical: “failure”,
“nonexistent”, “success”)
16. emp.var.rate: employment variation rate — (numeric)
17. cons.price.idx: consumer price index — (numeric)
18. cons.conf.idx: consumer confidence index — (numeric)
19. euribor3m: euribor 3 month rate — (numeric)
20. nr.employed: number of employees — (numeric)
Predict variable (desired target):
y — has the client subscribed a term deposit?
(binary: “1”, means “Yes”, “0” means “No”)

Our classes are imbalanced, and the ratio of nosubscription to subscription instances is 89:11.
• The average age of customers who bought
the term deposit is higher than that of the
customers who didn’t.
• The pdays (days since the customer was last
contacted) is understandably lower for the
customers who bought it. The lower the
pdays, the better the memory of the last call
and hence the better chances of a sale.
• Surprisingly, campaigns (number of contacts
or calls made during the current campaign)

are lower for customers who bought the term
deposit.
The frequency of purchase
of the deposit depends a
great deal on the job title.
Thus, the job title can be a
good predictor of the
outcome variable.
The marital status does not
seem a strong predictor for
the outcome variable.

Education seems a good
predictor of the
outcome variable.
Day of week may not be
a good predictor of the
outcome.

Month might be a good predictor of
the outcome variable.
Most of the customers of the bank in
this dataset are in the age range of
30–40.
